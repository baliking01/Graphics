Polygon elements:
	Vertices:
		x, y, z components for vec3

	Texture Coordinates(UV):
		u, v coordinates for 2d texture mapping
	
	Surface Normals:
		x, y, z for normal vectors

	Faces:
		A list of triangles each of which is defined by x, y ,z componenets

		In order to eliminate code repetition we store the index of each vertex
		of the polygon that defines these triangles along with the index of texture
		coordinates and surface normals.

		Thus the final polygon will be composed of triangles that are in turn defined
		by vertices. The surface normals correspond to these triangles and not to
		individual vertices.
